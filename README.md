My attempts at Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

## 2024

Some notes for 2024:

### Day 6

Got taught a valuable lesson as part of this day--breaks are really important. It's so often that answers will come when you give your brain the space in needs to think through the problem. Also, make sure you're building towards the actual problem at hand (to be fair, the part two is an intentional curveball, but still).

I also learned a little bit more intuitive usage of when functions should take a reference or consume a parameter (which felt nice). I also learned about .source() on errors, which will be nice on another project I'm working on.

Hopefully the next days are a bit easier and I can catch up ðŸ˜…

### Day 7

This was surprisingly easy! I hate recurision 100% still though. But was easy though.

### Day 8

I actually enjoyed this one a fair amount--it was really slick using the HashSets, they worked wonders for dealing with the frequencies. Could use some polish/it's a little brittle (the checks to determine which quadrant are bug prone), but more than fine for AoC IMO.
